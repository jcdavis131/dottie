## Goal state (updated by the 3-min loop, 02:57 2026-07-20 — clock verified)

### ⛔ FIRST: the fleet is DOWN and needs ONE command from you

The WSL2 VM died at ~02:05 and is crash-looping (vmmemWSL oscillates 8→123 MB;
`docker version` itself 500s). ALL 14 containers are gone — the 13-container factory
fleet **and** the T9.4 chat trainer. Nothing is lost (checkpoints on `ava_ckpt`,
manifest on `ava_state`), and I could not fix it: `wsl --shutdown` was blocked by the
permission classifier.

```powershell
wsl --shutdown          # then, if the engine doesn't return in ~2 min, restart Docker Desktop
```
Recovery is then automatic (restart policies + `--resume`); verification commands and a
fallback relaunch are in §1.3. **The 45W power cap is the standing suspect for the whole
family of failures tonight — 780MHz clocks, 2 CUBLAS crashes, and this VM death. Check
the charger.**

### What ran while you were away (all committed, ~25 commits)

Two lanes were alive: the **T9.4 chat branch** (trained steps 1→23 across two CUDA-flake
crashes, self-healing each time from banked checkpoints, until the VM took it down) and
the **host-side research loop** (unaffected by Docker — still ideating, implementing and
training).

THE NIGHT'S HEADLINES — read these before anything below:

1. **T9.3 DONE but gate FAIL**: tool_final.pt landed clean (step 1144, exit 0) and the
   REAL eval (evals/tool_gate.py, shipped tonight) measured general CE **+75.1%** vs
   base (bound ≤2%) — catastrophic forgetting. Root structural cause: the packed corpus
   has ZERO tool_selection-labeled docs (measured; the old eval command in the TODO
   pointed at a MOCK harness — also caught tonight). Trainer PARKED; §1.4 has the
   recommendation awaiting your sign-off (no knob-rerun; 2.1 data → re-fork w/ replay).
2. **§2.1 fleet rebuild DONE + verified**: 13/13 healthy on reconciled images,
   30-source registry live; collectors correctly paused on full runway. §2.2 blocked
   only on the next-run decision.
3. **Research loop: BOTH "SOTA" entries are artifacts (§5.3.R0) — honest count of real
   architectural wins is ZERO.** The older one beat a hand-seeded placeholder baseline
   (4.5) on an explicitly-not-capability synthetic task; the newer one (MLBR) is the
   noise+degenerate case below. The machinery works end-to-end; the results were
   mislabeled, and tonight's gates now block both failure modes. Original note: MLBR
   ratcheted the baseline 5.61982→5.60506, and then §5.3.R (below) took the bundle
   apart: the delta is **1.1 SEM** (inside noise) and the "MoE regularizer" is a
   parameter-free scalar shift that REPLACED a real block. Read §5.3.R before the
   bundle; it also lists the 3 cheap evaluate.py fixes this exposed (significance
   margin, param-delta in the verdict, paired seeds).
   Survived TWO outages tonight: 780MHz GPU = 45W power cap from 13% battery (not
   drivers — check the charger), and Ollama dead-since-reboot (user autostart + no
   login; PREVENTION item in §8 needs your password). Now converting on qwen3:14b
   nights: GASA implemented ready_for_training at 01:06 — the same hypothesis the
   parse_hypotheses key-repair fix rescued from a failed dump.
4. Also shipped: SOTA sparkline (5.4), last-seen badge (7.4), Factory v2 telemetry
   tiles (7.3), scout-cli MCP Windows stdin deadlock fix (real bug, was 'flaky'),
   logic-prover CRLF fix. FOUND: a THIRD split-brain checkout (C:\Users\jcdav\
   scout-cli shadows the monorepo via the shared venv) — added to §2.3.

5. **The research loop got four defenses tonight, all born from the MLBR post-mortem**
   (§5.3.R has the details): a **significance gate** (a win inside the noise can no
   longer move the baseline — replayed on MLBR: 1.1 SEM → HELD), a **degeneracy gate**
   (a module with no learnable parameters that only adds a constant can no longer reach
   training — MLBR's real module now fails L4), a **capacity caveat** (a swap that
   deletes parameters says so in the verdict and the bundle), and **§5.2.c**: the
   corrector now sees a diff of its own last edit. 33/33 tests green. Two of my own
   fixes had bugs caught by verification passes (a flaky threshold competing with float
   rounding; an unseeded probe) — both fixed and noted.
6. **arxiviq**: the live gist now serves fresh data, and the site code was verified
   headlessly for the first time (6/6 checks on a healthy payload). One honesty fix
   shipped: with the factory down the tiles said "unknown" + em-dashes; they now say
   **"factory unreachable"**. NOTE: site code changes are committed but **NOT deployed**
   — the Vercel deploy needs your approval (§7.5).

### YOUR DECISION QUEUE (in order)
1. **`wsl --shutdown`** — nothing else moves until the engine is back.
2. **Charger** — the physical root cause candidate for tonight's whole failure family.
3. **T9.3 path (§1.4)** — gate FAILED (+75.1% CE). My recommendation: no knob-rerun;
   get real tool data via 2.1, then re-fork with a replay mix. Trainer stays parked.
4. **T9.4**: it was launched per your directive and the step-15 early warning showed
   **+2.04% general CE** — the same forgetting mode, at 8% of the run. Decide whether to
   resume it after recovery (it will auto-resume from step_15 unless you stop it).
5. **MLBR bundle (§5.3.R)** — I recommend REJECT, with the arithmetic; also decide
   whether to re-seed the baseline back to 5.61982.
6. **Ollama startup task (§8)** and **§2.3 checkout retirement** (daytime; 3 checkouts).
7. **arxiviq deploy** (§7.5) — one command, or approve and I'll run it.

## Standing state (context for every step below)

- `dottie-factory` fleet (13 containers) runs ONLY from `apps/ava-factory`; trainer is
  mid **mini tool-branch (T9.3)**, ~1,144 steps total, bind-mounted code, monitor armed.
- The three-way fork (retired `ava-agi` / workspace `ava-agi-factory-v6-4` / monorepo)
  is **reconciled into the monorepo** (`4aabd3d`, `75ef9a6`): 431 factory tests pass.
  Containers still run pre-reconciliation IMAGE code until step 2.1 rebuilds them.
- Research loop: 4 scheduled tasks, qwen3:8b think=false, baseline `factory_lm_loss
  5.61982`; ideation refills 00:00 nightly.
- Agent OS: J-Space state store (`skills/state_store.py`), Hermes/OpenClaw profiles,
  forge self-evolution loop all live-verified; scout has `reviewgraph`.

## 0 — POWER DELIVERY, not drivers (root-caused 2026-07-19 23:56 by the loop)

REBOOT DONE (23:36) — fleet auto-healed 14/14, trainer auto-resumed from
/ckpt/tool/step_1035.pt (crash-resume verified in production). But the reboot did
NOT fix the clocks: SM still pinned at 780 MHz. MEASURED root cause via
`nvidia-smi -q -d PERFORMANCE,POWER`: **Current Power Limit 45 W** (hw max 175 W),
SW Power Cap + SW Thermal Slowdown active since boot. Battery at **13% on AC** —
the box ran down and the system is throttling the GPU while the battery recovers
(or the charger is underpowered). The whole evening's "degraded WSL GPU stack"
(780 MHz, 3-5x slow steps, likely the CUBLAS flakes too) was power delivery.

**PHYSICAL ACTION (user)**: confirm the OEM high-wattage adapter is the one plugged
in (not a USB-C/travel charger); let the battery charge. Verify recovery with
`nvidia-smi --query-gpu=power.limit,clocks.sm --format=csv` → expect ~175 W / >2 GHz.

Meanwhile training still advances at ~38 s/step under the cap: step 1050/1,144 at
23:55, ~94 steps left → tool_final.pt ETA ~01:00–01:30 even without the fix.
Then §1 fires automatically (#17 armed on the monitor).

## 1 — Close the T9.3 gate (blocking everything downstream)

1.1 [~] **Wait for `tool_final.pt`** (step 1110/1,144 at 00:35 2026-07-20; ~20 min out).
    NOTE: the ORIGINAL armed monitor + task #17 did NOT survive the session's machine
    move (task list empty, verified 00:40) — a fresh watch was re-armed from the new
    session (fires on tool_final.pt, container gone, or NaN/CUBLAS signatures). The
    eval-gate harness was smoke-checked in-container (imports + argparse OK).
    - 1.1.a If the monitor reports crash/NaN instead: `docker logs dottie-factory-trainer-1`,
      diagnose, restart run — do NOT advance to 1.2 without a finished checkpoint.
1.2 **Run the eval gate against the checkpoint** (real harness, no shortcuts):
    - **COMMAND CORRECTED 2026-07-20 00:55 (pre-fire)**: `eval_branch_harness.py` is
      MOCK/BLUEPRINT ONLY — its own docstring says every number is fabricated and
      `--mode real` refuses to run. Do NOT gate on it. `evals.run_harness` is real but
      covers base/chat probes only — no tool-routing metric exists yet anywhere.
    - 1.2.a [x] **`evals/tool_gate.py` SHIPPED + smoke-verified in-container** (CPU,
      base-vs-base, exit-code semantics 0/1/3). Read-only manifest access, val-split
      windows, planner-argmax + held-out CE per task_type, JSON verdict to /reports.
    - 1.2.a' **MEASURED CORPUS FINDING (2026-07-20 01:10, reframes T9.3)**: the packed
      corpus contains ZERO tool_selection-labeled docs — val census: 0 docs; full
      metrics history: 0 tool batches ever trained (943 deliberate / 421 automatic /
      81 temporal / 3 safety). The "tool branch" trained on the generic mix; only its
      router_bias prior + freeze pattern differ from base. Tool_use L2/L3 sources
      arrive with the 2.1 rebuild — AFTER this run. Therefore:
      * When tool_final lands: run `python -m evals.tool_gate` (GPU, defaults) →
        honest NONREGRESSION-ONLY verdict (general CE ≤2% + routing sanity).
      * The FULL tool gate (capability) is gated on 2.1 + tool-labeled val data, then
        continued branch training (or re-fork) on real tool batches.
      * DECISION for human: T9.4 chat branch has the same question — check the chat
        mix's task labels exist in the packed corpus BEFORE burning 90 min of GPU.
    - 1.2.b Compare tool-branch vs `base_final.pt` on: tool_selection routing accuracy
      (router argmax → planner on tool prompts), held-out LM loss on tool_use mix,
      frontier-rubric tool categories.
    - 1.2.c Record verdict in `apps/ava-factory/reports/REPORT_REAL.md` (committed) with
      the raw numbers. Acceptance: tool branch beats base on tool metrics WITHOUT
      >2% LM regression on the general mix.
1.3 **CHAT-MIX LABEL CHECK DONE (2026-07-20 01:20 — the 1.2.a' decision item)**:
    T9.4 is better positioned than T9.3 was. p5 train PACKED census: deliberate
    1,065M + temporal 174M + automatic 29M + **safety 22M** — the chat mix's labels
    exist in train (a 50M-token run at safety 0.20 needs ~10M; 22M covers it).
    CAVEAT: val synth_safety shards are MISLABELED (all 1,139 docs `automatic`,
    packed under an older config) → the chat gate can measure general CE + routing
    but NOT safety-specific metrics until val safety is repacked (2.1+). Launching
    T9.4 on this corpus is defensible; gate it like the tool branch (honest
    nonregression + routing) and re-gate on capability post-2.1.

    **T9.4 LAUNCHED 2026-07-20 01:44 (user directive via fork; per this section's
    "defensible" verdict)**: container `dottie-chat-branch`, forked base_final →
    /ckpt/chat, p5_anneal seq 4096, 50M tokens ≈ 191 steps.
    **ETA RE-CORRECTED ~02:12 (measured, steps 1→10)**: 53.6 s/step, tok/s 5449 →
    **~2.9h, chat_final ~04:40**. (The interim 5.5h number was modeled before the
    first inter-step interval existed — wrong method, retracted.) Full clocks
    (charger!) would still cut this substantially. Step-1 lm 0.1509 is EXPECTED
    (base_final trained through p5 already) — only the val-side gate can show
    forgetting; an early-warning CPU gate against step_30.pt (~02:20) is queued
    in the loop.
    **WATCH RE-ARMED from the loop session ~02:05**: the fork's watch (by5bexxzs)
    did NOT survive the fork's termination (TaskList empty — watches die with their
    session, same lesson as the machine-move at 00:40). New watch: chat_final.pt /
    container exit / crash signatures, 60s poll.
    ### ⚠ TIMESTAMP CORRECTION (written 02:26, verified against `date`)
    Every clock time I wrote in this section between the T9.4 launch and 02:26 was
    ESTIMATED, not read — they run ~1–1.5 h fast (and the fork's "01:44 launch" is
    also wrong). Trust ONLY these log-derived anchors:
    | event | real local time |
    |---|---|
    | chat step 1 | **01:25:14** |
    | crash 1 (step 15, CUDA unknown error) | **01:38:12** |
    | resumed from step_15.pt | **01:45:39** |
    | step 20 | **01:51:33** |
    | crash 2 (step 23, CUBLAS_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR) | **01:56:39** |
    | restart boot: model_built / branch_forked / init_loaded | **02:00:30 / 02:01:55 / 02:03:49** |
    | WSL VM death (engine 500s first seen) | **~02:05** |
    | OSA implemented by the loop (host-side, unaffected) | **02:16:43** |
    So: two crashes **18.5 min apart** (01:38 → 01:57) still stands — that interval
    came from epoch subtraction, not from the wrong wall-clock labels, and so does
    the ~29 steps/h throughput figure.

    ## >>> BLOCKED ON USER: WSL VM DEAD, WHOLE FLEET DOWN (~02:05 → now) <<<

    **What happened**: docker API 500s on EVERY call including `docker version` —
    not a container fault. `vmmemWSL` collapsed 755 MB → **34 MB** (dead, not
    booting) and `com.docker.backend` burned only ~2 CPU-s in 7 min (idle, not
    recovering). The WSL2 VM hosting all 14 containers is gone: factory fleet (13)
    + the chat trainer. Same degraded-WSL-GPU family as the 780MHz/CUBLAS flakes;
    the 45W power cap is the standing suspect (a reboot cleared it last night).

    **Nothing is lost**: every checkpoint is on the named volume `ava_ckpt`
    (`/ckpt/chat/step_15.pt` banked), the manifest is on `ava_state`, and the
    research loop is host-side (unaffected — it kept running).

    **RECOVERY — run ONE of these (Claude is blocked by the permission classifier
    from doing it; both are safe and the fleet self-heals afterwards):**
    ```powershell
    wsl --shutdown                      # clears the wedged VM; Docker restarts it
    # if the engine does not return within ~2 min, also:
    #   quit Docker Desktop from the tray, then relaunch it
    ```
    **After the engine returns, expected automatic behavior**: the 13 factory
    containers come back on their restart policies; `dottie-chat-branch`
    (`--restart on-failure`, command carries `--resume`) re-resumes from
    step_15.pt with the new cadence-8 config. Verify with
    `docker ps --format "{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"` (expect 14) and
    `docker logs dottie-chat-branch --tail 3` (expect a `resumed` event).
    If the chat container does NOT come back, relaunch it with:
    ```
    cd apps/ava-factory
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.tool-fork.yml run -d \
      --name dottie-chat-branch trainer python -m dottie.train --preset mini \
      --branch chat --init /ckpt/base_final.pt --run /ckpt/chat --resume
    docker update --restart on-failure dottie-chat-branch
    ```
    **THROUGHPUT UNDER FLAKING — MEASURED ~03:20 (this is the real ETA)**: two
    CUBLAS/CUDA crashes 18.5 min apart (ts 1784529492 step 15, ts 1784530599 step 23),
    each costing ~3 min of boot + every step since the last checkpoint. Net rate:
    ~9 steps per 18.5-min cycle ≈ **29 steps/h** (cadence 8) vs ~18 steps/h had the
    cadence stayed 15 — the ratchet is measurably net-positive but the honest ETA for
    the remaining ~176 steps is **~6h (≈09:15)**, NOT 05:00. Both crash traces sit in
    the gradient-checkpointing recompute path under bf16 GEMM at 45W/780MHz.
    **THE FIX IS PHYSICAL**: full power would likely remove both the flakes and the
    3-5x clock penalty → ~1-1.5h. No mid-run experiments (micro-batch, ckpt off) are
    being attempted unattended: the directive was monitor-to-completion, and an
    unmeasured recipe change mid-flight would poison the endpoint measurement.
    **MONITORING NOW TICK-DRIVEN (~03:05)**: three background watches were externally
    killed in a row — treating that as deliberate and not re-arming. The 3-min loop
    itself polls each tick: step_60.pt → run 48w confirmation gate; chat_final.pt →
    final gate; container Exited → triage. Restart policy on the container is the
    crash safety net (auto-resume).
    **EARLY WARNING ~02:50 (step-15 CPU gate, 12 windows, paired seed)**: general CE
    base 3.811 → chat_step15 3.889 = **+2.04%** — nominally past the 2% bound at 8%
    of the run, with LR still warming. The tool branch's forgetting mode appears to
    be REPRODUCING at 1/6 tokens. Small sample (12w) → directional, not precise.
    Per the standing run-to-completion directive the run continues; NEXT: full-size
    (48w) confirmation gate at step ~60 (~03:15), and the final gate remains the
    decision point. If you want to abort early and save ~2h GPU: `docker stop
    dottie-chat-branch` (safe — checkpoints every 15 steps are already banked).
    **CRASH + RECOVERY ~02:25**: CUDA "unknown error" in grad-ckpt recompute at
    step 15→16 (the overnight flake family) — step_15.pt had saved 18s earlier, so
    zero loss. The fork's docker-run had NO restart policy (crash was terminal).
    Relaunched via the documented compose command + `--resume` (git-bash MSYS
    path-mangling ate the first attempt — MSYS_NO_PATHCONV required), then
    `docker update --restart on-failure`: future flakes now auto-resume from the
    latest ckpt (command carries --resume), exit-0 completion stays down. Watch
    re-armed. NOTE the flake recurred at 45W/780MHz — the power-cap⇄CUBLAS-flake
    correlation now has another data point (charger!).
    Old July-10 nano-era /ckpt/chat ckpts preserved as *.nano-20260710.bak.
    Completion/failure watch armed (fires the session on chat_final.pt, clean exit,
    crash, or CUBLAS/NaN signatures). GATE NEXT: nonregression-only eval vs
    base_final (expect the forgetting risk the tool branch showed, at 1/6 the
    token count). HARNESS READY (adapted ~01:55): `evals/tool_gate.py` now takes
    `--candidate-ckpt/--candidate-label`; wake-time command:
    `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.tool-fork.yml run --rm trainer \
     python -m evals.tool_gate --candidate-ckpt /ckpt/chat/chat_final.pt \
     --candidate-label chat --out /reports/chat_gate.json`

    Original plan (**if gate passes → chat branch (T9.4)**): same overlay pattern,
    `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.tool-fork.yml run --rm trainer \
     python -m dottie.train --preset mini --branch chat --init /ckpt/base_final.pt --run /ckpt/chat`
    (50M tokens ≈ 90 min). Same gate discipline (1.2) for chat metrics.
1.4 **GATE RAN 2026-07-20 01:29 — VERDICT: FAIL (REGRESSED)**. tool_final vs
    base_final on held-out val (GPU, real): general CE **+75.1%** (bound ≤2%);
    deliberate +142%, automatic +46%, temporal −28%; tool checks UNMEASURED (no
    tool-labeled data exists). Full numbers: reports/REPORT_REAL.md + tool_gate.json.
    Failure mode: catastrophic forgetting/overfit to the p3 slice (train lm ~0.15).
    **RECOMMENDATION (needs human sign-off): do NOT knob-and-rerun** — the corpus
    cannot support the branch's purpose (zero tool data); do NOT launch T9.4 on this
    recipe either. Instead: §2.1 rebuild (window is OPEN, trainer exited clean) →
    collect real tool_use data → re-fork with a gentler recipe (lower LR / shorter run
    / replay mix of earlier phases to prevent forgetting). Original knob-rerun
    guidance retired: two failures = rethink curriculum; this failure is structural.

## 2 — Redeploy the fleet on reconciled code (after 1.1, before long collector runs)

2.1 **Rebuild + restart with the reconciled tree** (new datagen union + post-mini sources):
    - 2.1.a [x] Images rebuilt 2026-07-20 01:35 (ava/cpu + ava/gpu, cache-fast).
    - 2.1.b [x] 01:38: collector×4, curator×6, janitor, server recreated on new images.
      **Trainer DELIBERATELY left down** — gate failed; no new run without human
      sign-off (also avoids an exit-0 restart loop on the finished branch command).
    - 2.1.c [x] VERIFIED 01:50: **13/13 healthy**; collector_boot logs **"sources": 30**
      (new registry live — also closes §8's post-rebuild check); `/pipeline/status`
      responds (mode reads stale "training" off the dead trainer's demand.json — decays).
      CAVEAT: collectors correctly PAUSED ("packed runway 3.22B >= max 3.00B") so new
      source keys won't EMIT until a trainer drains runway — 2.2 is blocked on the
      human decision about the next run, not on the rebuild.
2.2 **Verify mixture flow end-to-end**: after 1h, `manifest` tokens_ready per phase
    rises; curator rejects stay <20%; no `unknown generator` errors anywhere.
2.3 **Retire the old checkouts** — AUDITED 2026-07-19 late: workspace clean; retired ava-agi's 97 dirty files all captured by the reconciliation (0 changed since); both safe to rename (they are now strictly historical):
    - 2.3.a `git -C C:\Users\jcdav\ava-agi status` → confirm nothing uncommitted worth saving.
    - 2.3.a' ADD to the retirement list (found 2026-07-20): `C:\Users\jcdav\scout-cli` —
      a standalone scout-cli checkout pip-installed (develop) into the shared venv;
      it shadows the monorepo copy everywhere except under apps/scout-cli. Audit for
      unmerged work, then retire + `pip install -e` the monorepo copy instead.
    - 2.3.b Rename both dirs to `*-RETIRED-20260719` (do not delete yet); update
      `AVA_FACTORY_ROOT` in `research_env.local.ps1` to the MONOREPO factory path and
      re-register scheduler tasks; re-run `calibrate-baseline` if the packed corpus moves.
    - 2.3.c After 2 quiet weeks: delete.

## 3 — Promote mini to be Dottie's brain (the "assistant runs on OUR model" milestone)

3.1 **Serve the gated checkpoint**: point `server` service `AVA_CKPT` at the winning
    branch ckpt; `AVA_SKIP_ENGINE_BOOT=0` window (stop trainer first — 12 GB card).
3.2 [x] **Wire dottie engine -> served model** (FactoryPolicy over :8000/chat; DOTTIE_POLICY=factory; live probe green — flip after the gate): `apps/dottie` policy currently defaults to
    Ollama; add a `DOTTIE_POLICY=factory` path that hits `:8000/generate` with the same
    honest-refusal semantics. Acceptance: `apps/dottie` test suite passes with the
    factory policy env set + one real conversation transcript saved to task_logs.
3.3 **A/B against qwen3:8b** on 20 fixed assistant prompts (tool selection, math,
    safety refusal); record per-prompt win/loss in `reports/` — promote only on ≥60% wins
    for tool tasks. Honest outcome if it loses: keep qwen3:8b, file gaps into §5.
3.4 **arxiviq assistant surface**: enable the server's CORS block for arxiviq.com
    (already reconciled in `server.py`), connect the site chat to `/generate`, stream
    tokens, log traces into `task_logs` (P5 anneal feedstock — closes the flywheel).

## 4 — Scale to base1b (only after 3.x proves mini is useful)

4.1 **Grow-init from the promoted mini** (machinery shipped in `89713ff`):
    - 4.1.a `python -m dottie.grow --src /ckpt/<winner>.pt --src-preset mini
      --dst-preset base1b --out /ckpt/base1b/grown_init.pt --validate`
    - 4.1.b Acceptance: `grown_loss` well below `fresh_dst_loss` in the validation
      block; manifest shows zero unexpected `dst_only` tensors.
4.2 **Memory feasibility on the 4080 — measure, don't argue**: `--max-steps 20` smoke
    with `optimizer.name: adamw8bit` (bitsandbytes is already wired in train.py),
    gradient_checkpointing on, micro-batch 1. Record torch peak alloc. If it spills
    >1 GB into sysmem → 4.4 (cloud) is the answer, full stop.
4.3 **Distillation pre-pass (optional, 2× sample efficiency)**: precompute top-8
    teacher logits (Qwen2.5-7B, Apache-2.0) over the M1 shard set (~32 GB disk);
    add a KL term gated by `training.distill:` config. Tokenizer decision first:
    adopting the teacher's tokenizer is the load-bearing choice — spec it before code.
4.4 **M1 milestone (2B tokens)**: local ≈ 2+ weeks 24/7 vs ~1-2 days on one rented
    A100-80GB. Gate at M1 per `configs/base1b.yaml milestones:` — "probes: arithmetic/
    logic clearly above mini" — before ANY further spend.

## 5 — Research loop: keep hill-climbing the architecture (∥ continuous)

5.1 **Tonight's cycle**: ideation refills at 00:00 with qwen3:8b; hourly ticks chew it.
    Morning check: `python -m dottie.research status` — expect ≥3 new experiments tried.
5.2 **Raise the conversion rate** (currently 0 of 7 candidates pass validation):
    - 5.2.a [x] Add `--max-retries 5` (scheduler re-registered 2026-07-19 evening) for the implement worker on the scheduler (cheap now
      that transport bugs are gone — failures are content-level).
    - 5.2.b [~] Nightly window: MECHANISM shipped in research_worker.ps1 (DOTTIE_OLLAMA_MODEL_NIGHT); do NOT enable until the tool run frees the GPU — when the trainer is idle (post-tool_final, pre-next-run),
      let the scheduler use qwen3:14b (`DOTTIE_OLLAMA_MODEL_NIGHT` env in the wrapper,
      22:00–06:00) — 14b stalls only under GPU contention.
    - 5.2.c [x] **SHIPPED 02:45** — the corrector now sees its OWN last edit: from the
      second retry on, the feedback carries a bounded unified diff (previous_attempt →
      current_attempt), and a byte-identical resubmission is called out explicitly.
      Rationale: the traceback says what broke, the diff says what the model just tried —
      different questions, and near-greedy sampling kept re-making the same edit. 32/32
      research tests green (new test asserts both branches).
### 5.3.R0 — BOTH sota entries are artifacts, for DIFFERENT reasons (audited 02:58)

The ledger says `sota: 2`. Neither is a measured architectural improvement:

- **`bc3dbb74bead` "Hierarchical Attention"** — the module is REAL (5 Linear projections,
  genuine two-branch attention; it passes the new degeneracy gate correctly). The
  *promotion* is what's hollow: it beat baseline **4.5** — the hand-seeded placeholder
  from the runbook example (`seed-baseline --value 4.5`), not a calibrated number — on a
  task its own metrics label *"synthetic next-token shift (proxy micro-benchmark, NOT
  downstream capability)"*. Delta −4.345 (4.5 → 0.155) is a 97% "improvement", which is
  the signature of comparing against a made-up number.
- **`23bb41375804` MLBR** — real baseline, real corpus, but a degenerate module and a
  within-noise delta (§5.3.R below).

**So the honest count of real, measured architectural wins so far is ZERO.** That is a
statement about the RESULTS, not the machinery: ideate→implement→validate→train→evaluate
demonstrably runs end-to-end unattended, and tonight's gates now block both failure modes.
- [ ] GAP this exposes (cheap, queued): nothing distinguishes a CALIBRATED baseline
  (`calibrate-baseline`, real recipe recorded) from a hand-SEEDED placeholder
  (`seed-baseline --value 4.5`). `Baseline.experiment_id` is None for seeded ones — the
  verdict should say "promoted against a hand-seeded baseline, not a measured one", and
  a sota won on a placeholder should arguably never enter a promotion bundle.

### 5.3.R — REVIEWER BRIEF for the MLBR bundle (written by the loop 2026-07-20 03:30)

**Recommendation: REJECT the promotion (or re-measure with paired seeds). Two
independent reasons, both from the bundle's own numbers/code:**

1. **The "improvement" is inside the noise.** The bundle reports 20 held-out CE
   batches; their std is **0.0600**, so SEM = 0.0600/√20 = **0.0134**. The claimed
   delta is **−0.01476 = 1.1 SEM** — nowhere near the ~2 SEM needed to call it real,
   and the baseline (5.61982) carries its own unreported error. The ledger's
   `improved: true` is a raw `<` comparison with no significance test; that is the
   machinery's real gap, not a lie.
2. **The candidate module is not what its hypothesis claims.** `candidate.py`
   defines no experts, no routing, and no load balancing: it computes a single
   SCALAR (`-mean over B,S of logsumexp(λx) over hidden`) and broadcasts it onto
   every activation. It has **zero learnable parameters** — and the run swapped it
   in for a real fusion block (`swap_layer: 3`, params 13.00M vs the 13.79M
   baseline). So the measured effect is mostly "delete a block from a 150-step
   under-trained nano", a classic smoke-scale artifact. (`exp(λx)` is also
   overflow-fragile once activations grow.)

**Fixes SHIPPED 2026-07-20 ~03:55 (evaluate.py + 2 tests, 29/29 green):**
- [x] Promotion now requires `|delta| ≥ 2×SEM` of the candidate's own per-batch
  series (`eval_ce_per_batch` / `per_seed` / `eval_losses`, first present wins).
  REPLAYED against the real MLBR numbers: n=20, std 0.06002, sem 0.01342,
  |delta|/sem = **1.10** → **HELD (noise)**. The gate rejects what it promoted.
- [x] No series recorded ⇒ `significant: null` ⇒ HELD, never assumed — the ratchet
  only moves on evidence.
- [x] Verdict now carries `sem`, `sem_n`, `sem_series`, `significance` (the
  arithmetic in words) and `candidate_params`; the write-up shows Significance.
- [ ] STILL OPEN (needs a design decision): paired-seed evaluation — same seeds for
  baseline and candidate would kill most of this variance rather than just gating on
  it. Also: baselines record no param count, so the param comparison is informational
  only (recorded, not gated) until `Baseline` carries params.
- VERIFIED after shipping (second-order check): BOTH trainer paths record a series —
  `factory_trainer` writes `eval_ce_per_batch`, the proxy writes `per_seed` — so the
  new gate does NOT freeze the ratchet. And stated honestly in code: because the stored
  baseline has no spread, a 2×SEM bar against a POINT baseline is ≈1.4 SE_diff (~84%
  confidence), not 95% — a floor, not a proof. Kept at 2.0 for statistical power;
  paired seeds are the real fix.
- [x] **DEGENERACY GATE shipped in validate.py L4 (02:35)** — the other half of the
  MLBR post-mortem: the 4-level validator checked import/instantiate/shape/finiteness
  but nothing stopped a module that *does nothing*. Now a candidate FAILS L4 when it
  has **0 learnable parameters AND** its output differs from its input by a **constant**
  (`std(out-in) < 1e-6`). Both conditions required, so the legitimate zero-init pattern
  (LayerScale: identity at init but parameterized) still passes. Verified on the REAL
  bundle module: MLBR → FAIL ("0 learnable parameters … differs by a CONSTANT");
  LayerScale (4224 params) → pass; a real mixer (delta_std 0.465) → pass. Passing
  results now also record `learnable_params` and `delta_std` for the reviewer.
  Found en route: a test fixture (`x * scale`, scale=1.0) was itself a zero-param exact
  identity — fixture fixed, gate kept.
  **HARDENED 02:45 — the first version of this gate was FLAKY.** An absolute `1e-6`
  bar competed with float32 rounding noise from `x + c`, which scales with |c| (~5e-7
  for c≈4.7) and varied with the UNSEEDED probe input, so the same module could pass or
  fail run to run. Two fixes: (1) the constant-shift test is now scale-aware
  (`std ≤ max(1e-6, 1e-4·|mean|)`), and (2) the dry-run probe is seeded (1234) so
  validation is reproducible at all. Re-verified on the real modules + 5 repeat runs.
- [ ] **DEEPEST ISSUE FOUND TONIGHT — the block-swap integration has a structural
  confound (queued, needs your call).** `factory_nano_block_swap` measures a candidate
  by REPLACING a real parameterized fusion block with it. So every parameter-free
  candidate silently also *removes capacity*, and its measured delta conflates "new
  idea" with "smaller model at fixed steps". MLBR (0 params) exploited this; the queued
  OSA candidate (`71a62346df0a`) has the SAME shape — pre-flighted 02:37: it passes the
  new degeneracy gate legitimately (0 params but delta_std 1.224, a real input-dependent
  whitening), yet it will still be measured with 0.79M fewer params than baseline.
  Options: (a) [x] **DONE 02:50 — recording only, no gating.** The factory trainer now
  measures the replaced block and the candidate BEFORE the swap and records
  `replaced_block_params` / `candidate_block_params` / `block_param_delta`; the evaluator
  turns a non-zero delta into a plain-English `capacity_caveat` in the verdict AND a
  "**Capacity caveat:**" line in the write-up (so promotion bundles carry it). For MLBR
  that reads: "the swapped block REMOVED 786,432 parameters vs the block it replaced …
  a fixed-step comparison partly measures capacity, not just the idea."
  (b) require the swapped block to match the replaced block's param count within a
  tolerance; (c) ADD the candidate alongside the block instead of replacing it, so
  capacity only goes up. **(b)/(c) still need your call — they change what gets measured.**
  NOTE also, unrelated to the confound: OSA's math does not implement its own hypothesis
  — `inverse(sqrt(AᵀA))` is an elementwise sqrt followed by a matrix inverse, not the
  inverse matrix square root orthogonalization claims; and AᵀA is computed over the
  BATCH, making inference batch-dependent. Worth a look when reviewing its result.
- [ ] YOUR CALL on the live ledger: MLBR (`23bb41375804`) was promoted under the old
  bare-`<` rule and MOVED the baseline 5.61982→5.60506. Options: (a) leave it — the
  bundle is human-gated anyway and §5.3.R documents the truth; (b) re-seed the
  baseline back to 5.61982 (`python -m dottie.research seed-baseline --value 5.61982
  --metric factory_lm_loss --architecture nano`) so the ratchet starts from the honest
  number. I did NOT touch the live ledger unattended.

5.3 [x] **Close the loop into the factory** (sota -> promotion bundle: candidate.py + evidence + ab_nano.py, runner-automatic, human-gated): when an experiment reaches `sota`, generate a
    `deltanet_layers`-style patch PR against `model_1b.py` + a nano A/B run script;
    human-review gate before it touches mini/base1b presets.
5.4 [x] **Report** (sparkline shipped 2026-07-20 00:20 — sota_history now carries
    metric_name/baseline_value from each verdict; site draws seed→sota series for the
    CURRENT metric regime only, retired-regime points counted out loud, not plotted):
    trigger was met tonight — **first real SOTA landed**: MLBR (`23bb41375804`)
    factory_lm_loss 5.61982→5.60506, baseline ratcheted; 2 promotion bundles built
    automatically under `data/research/promotions/` — **HUMAN REVIEW PENDING** (note:
    `bc3dbb74bead` is from the retired proxy_loss regime; review MLBR first).

## 6 — Agent OS hardening (∥ with 1–5)

6.1 [x] **Hermes auto-forge** (successful routines register parseable plugin drafts + human-gated forge_proposal commands): today `after_run` registers a routine sketch into
    skills_library; next: template that sketch into a real `forge new/edit` invocation
    behind `--refine` (human-confirmed), reusing the loop test's contract template.
6.2 [~] **OpenClaw channels** (cli + arxiviq SHIPPED 2026-07-20 ~01:40): scout's
    profiles now write channel `cli` explicitly; the engine's record_task takes an
    explicit channel or `DOTTIE_CHANNEL` env (compose tags the arxiviq-facing dottie
    service `arxiviq`); KNOWN_CHANNELS documented in jspace_state. Cross-surface
    visibility verified by tests on BOTH sides (engine 12/12, profiles 6/6 — real
    store, tmp DB, no mocks). REMAINING: the `research` channel — the research loop
    runs under its own session_id, and session_snapshot is per-session, so making
    research state visible to scout/arxiviq sessions needs either a well-known shared
    session_id convention or a store-level cross-session view. That's a design
    choice — pick one before wiring it.
6.3 **reviewgraph into the workflow**: pre-commit hook (or `scout system audit` step)
    that runs `reviewgraph blast --diff HEAD` and blocks on new high-fan-in touches
    without tests. Wire `context` into /code-review usage docs.
    RECON 2026-07-20 01:15 (dry-run done): blast works from apps/scout-cli — ~3s,
    parseable JSON (counts.impacted_files etc). TWO constraints for the hook:
    (a) it MUST pin cwd/interpreter to the monorepo copy — the shared venv's
    installed bigbang resolves to `C:\Users\jcdav\scout-cli` (a THIRD standalone
    checkout, no reviewgraph plugin) and silently wins outside apps/scout-cli;
    (b) ship WARN-ONLY first, flip to blocking after observing false-positive
    rate on real commits (a blocking gate armed untested would bite the loop
    and parallel sessions).
6.4 [x] **Skill auto-docs** (forge new scaffolds SKILL.md; forge rm cleans it; loop test asserts it): `forge new` should scaffold SKILL.md (frontmatter:
    j_space_target, triggers) so `skill install` works without the manual step the
    loop test had to do.
6.5 [x] **State-store telemetry cron** (watermarked export, hourly hidden task live on this box): hourly `export_telemetry` append into
    `reports/dottie_telemetry.jsonl` (gitignored) so agent activity reaches the
    Control Plane dashboards alongside factory telemetry.

## 7 — arxiviq.com platform polish

7.1 [x] LIVE-STATUS FIXED: site was on the frozen legacy fallback (hygiene keeps repo telemetry uncommitted) — hourly gist feed published from the box, app.js reads gist-first (df6796c). Original item: Control Plane fetches `dottie/main/apps/ava-factory/` — verify all dashboards
    render post-reconciliation (dashboard_html/ecosystem_html/evals_html were merged).
7.2 Assistant tab: 3.4's chat + a visible "which brain" indicator (factory ckpt vs
    Ollama fallback) — honesty in the UI too.
7.5 [x] **Site render VERIFIED headlessly + factory-down honesty fix (02:55)**: the
    browser extension isn't connected, so instead the REAL `app.js` was run against the
    REAL gist payload in a DOM shim (harness: `$CLAUDE_JOB_DIR/tmp/site_render_check.js`,
    takes a payload path as argv). Healthy payload → 6/6 checks pass (tok/s 7541,
    phase 75%, run 82%, 601 shards, no NaN, badge "live · box seen …") — tonight's
    telemetry/badge/sparkline work confirmed working for the first time.
    FOUND + FIXED en route: when the box is up but the FACTORY is unreachable (exactly
    tonight's WSL crash — the publisher honestly wrote `pipeline: {unreachable}` at 02:20
    and that IS what the live gist serves right now), the tiles rendered bare em-dashes
    and "Factory mode: unknown", which reads like missing data rather than a down
    service. Now: a critical "factory unreachable" chip plus a note naming the reason
    and stating that no pipeline numbers are shown rather than stale ones.
7.3 [x] Research tab: 5.4 (sparkline, shipped). Factory tab: SHIPPED 2026-07-20 —
    telemetry tiles now read the gist payload's v2 `.pipeline` block (tok/s from
    trainer.last, phase+run % from watch.*_progress, mode chip with honest ·stale
    flag); legacy v1 and baked-snapshot fallbacks retained.
7.4 [x] "Last seen" badge shipped 2026-07-20 (the preferred honest option): the source
    badge now reads the gist feed's published_utc — "live · box seen X ago" when <2h,
    "stale · box last seen X ago" beyond (2 missed hourly beats = asleep), old
    behavior when the feed lacks the field. "Live" now means the BOX is live, not
    that a CDN fetch succeeded.

## 8 — Known issues backlog (honest ledger, none import-breaking)

- [x] `test_audit_fixes`: 10 passed — judge layer 3-way merged (workspace .label audit-fixes + monorepo rubric evolution), logic pipeline ported blueprint-judge failures (MetaMuseJudge.label, judge source
  literals) — the judge layer needs its own reconciliation pass vs workspace.
- [x] `test_cpu_pilot_manifest`: fixed — runs/-suffix resolution + honest skip (10 passed/1 skip). Was: 3 × — environmental: expect `runs/cpu_pilot` artifacts;
  regenerate via `scripts/cpu_pilot_e2e.py` or mark skip-if-absent.
- [x] `test_janitor` reclaim count: was the ava/dottie double-import split brain — fixed by the ava.* meta-path alias finder (with 3 other split-brain failures).
- [x] `test_server_endpoints`: retired lineage moved the file report to /report/offline; updated test file ported (18 passed).
- 966 ruff findings in ported legacy code (CI excludes ava-factory; burn down
  opportunistically, never in bulk-reformat commits).
- [x] scout-cli python3-stub tests: swept to sys.executable (25 failures -> 10; survivors below).
- [x] scout-cli Windows portability: WNOHANG guarded, CLI stdout UTF-8, perms asserts POSIX-only — 129/130 green.
- [x] test_mcp_serve stdio scenario: was NOT environmental — real Windows bug, root-caused
  2026-07-20 by elimination (stdin-pipe, minimal-env, no-console, held-lock all refuted;
  live-server child-never-ran vs DEVNULL-0.11s was the discriminator): `_dispatch`'s
  subprocess inherited the MCP stdio transport pipe (overlapped Proactor pipe) as stdin
  and child Python hung in runtime init. Fix: `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL`. 90s-timeout →
  passes in 2.25s.
- [ ] test_api.py 4 env failures on this box (pre-existing, verified vs HEAD 2026-07-20):
  echo task / task counts / ollama honest-fail / flywheel gate all hit
  `DottieResolutionError: ava-...` — AVA_FACTORY_ROOT resolution, not code. Fix the env
  (research_env.local.ps1 → monorepo factory path, §2.3.b) then re-run.
- [x] `test_logic_prover` jsonl: fixed 2026-07-20 — write_text CRLF'd the corpus on
  Windows so the real file was 300 bytes bigger than the skill's reported
  bytes_written (its own honesty claim). Now write_bytes, LF everywhere; 6/6 pass.
- [x] `test_flow`: same split brain (patched free_gb on the wrong module copy); alias finder fixed it.

### New items (added 2026-07-19 evening)

- [x] §5: `DOTTIE_OLLAMA_MODEL_NIGHT=qwen3:14b` enabled 2026-07-20 ~00:50 (tool run done,
  trainer parked → contention gone; NUM_GPU stays 0 per GPU doctrine). Next research
  tick in the 22-06 window picks it up; watch the first 14b ideation for stalls.
- [x] §5 INCIDENT (2026-07-20 01:05): **Ollama was down since the 23:36 reboot** — it's a
  user-level autostart and the box rebooted to the lock screen (no login → no Ollama).
  The 00:05 research runner honestly refused all hour ("will not fabricate"), counts
  froze; task result 0x8007042B. Fixed: `ollama serve` started 01:05:15; the 01:05
  runner's retries pick it up (first 14b night run). Loop-verify next tick.
- [ ] **PREVENTION (user action)**: register a machine-level Task Scheduler job — At
  startup, run `ollama serve` as your user "whether logged on or not" (needs your
  password at registration, so Claude can't do it) — or switch Ollama to a Windows
  service. Without this, every unattended reboot silently kills the research loop
  until someone logs in.
- [ ] **§5 runner incident 3 (03:00) — SAME zombie pattern, now understood.** The task
  sat in state `Running` with NO worker process alive (checked: no python/powershell from
  that instance), i.e. Task Scheduler still believed a run was in flight. With
  `MultipleInstances=IgnoreNew` that would have silently refused the 03:05 trigger, just
  like 02:05. Cleared with `Stop-ScheduledTask` → state Ready, next 03:05 armed.
  **This is now 2 of 3 hourly ticks lost to the same cause**, so it is a real reliability
  bug, not bad luck. Fix options for you: (a) set the task's `MultipleInstances` to
  `Parallel` or `Queue` (the wrapper already holds an exclusive lock, so concurrent
  workers cannot actually collide — the lock, not the scheduler, should be the guard);
  (b) add `Stop-ScheduledTask` self-healing at wrapper start; (c) find why the instance
  exits without Task Scheduler noticing (0xC000013A earlier suggests the process tree is
  being killed abnormally). (a) is the cheapest and matches the existing lock design.
- [ ] §5 runner incident 2 (02:15): the 01:05 runner instance died with 0xC000013A
  (console-interrupt semantics; cause UNEXPLAINED — no ExecutionTimeLimit is set) and
  its still-running corpse made `IgnoreNew` swallow the 02:05 trigger. Recovered by
  manual Start-ScheduledTask 02:16 (GASA trains this run). If 0xC000013A recurs,
  instrument the wrapper (trap + exit-code logging) before theorizing.
- [x] §5: ideation raw-dumps reviewed 2026-07-20 — new shape found (mid-word-corrupted
  key `"hypo,thesis_name"` killed a whole 3-idea batch) and fixed with canonical-skeleton
  key repair in parse_hypotheses (fill-only, deterministic). Swept all 9 accumulated
  dumps: 9/9 now parse (27/27 research tests green).
- [~] Curriculum (landed a3abac0/f7d3a68 by parallel forks): megawika staged at
  weight 0 — needs on-box schema check + adapter before enabling; Mind2Web staged —
  needs an action-trace adapter; per-event cross-attestation filter is future curator work.
- [ ] §7: after fleet rebuild, verify the Control Plane source tables show the 30-source
  registry and the new telemetry stream renders.

### Weekly ops sweep (2026-07-20 00:45 — measured, safe actions taken)

- Done: dangling-image prune reclaimed **6.4 GB**; `git gc` run. Disk: 139 GB free.
- [ ] **Janitor does NOT rotate branch-run checkpoints**: /ckpt/tool = **51 GB** (~29 ×
  1.76 GB, every step file 50→1110 present; the 15-step crash cadence multiplied this).
  After tool_final lands + eval gate passes: keep tool_final + last 2 steps, delete the
  rest (~45 GB back), then extend the janitor's rotation to /ckpt/<branch>/ dirs.
- [ ] Deferred deliberately: build-cache prune (36.5 GB — it speeds the §2.1 rebuild;
  prune AFTER 2.1) and `docker image prune -a` (23 GB more — old images are rollback
  insurance until the rebuilt fleet proves out; prune after 2.2 verification).

## 9 — Ops discipline (standing)

9.1 Monitors: keep the trainer monitor armed each run; add one for collector
    starvation (`tokens_ready` flat >6h → notify).
9.2 Weekly: `git gc` the monorepo, prune Docker images (`docker system df` first),
    check `ava_ckpt` volume growth vs janitor rotation.
9.3 Every session: `git pull` before committing (parallel Claude sessions are active);
    factory suite before any factory push; never leave conflict markers on disk in
    bind-mounted trees (the trainer restart-imports them).
9.4 Lane splits for parallel sessions: two agents racing on the same file
    (`adapters.py`/`sources.yaml`, observed 2026-07-19) resolved cleanly only by
    luck of additive edits — when spawning parallel work, assign disjoint file
    lanes explicitly (curriculum registry vs adapters vs tests), and the second
    lane pulls before touching anything shared.
