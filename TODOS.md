# TODOS — the road to the Agentic Assistant platform at arxiviq.com

> Unified execution roadmap, reconciled 2026-07-19. One rule inherited from everything
> that worked so far: **every number is measured, every gate is real, every step names
> its acceptance criterion.** Work top to bottom; parallelize only where marked ∥.
> Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only.

## Standing state (context for every step below)

- `dottie-factory` fleet (13 containers) runs ONLY from `apps/ava-factory`; trainer is
  mid **mini tool-branch (T9.3)**, ~1,144 steps total, bind-mounted code, monitor armed.
- The three-way fork (retired `ava-agi` / workspace `ava-agi-factory-v6-4` / monorepo)
  is **reconciled into the monorepo** (`4aabd3d`, `75ef9a6`): 431 factory tests pass.
  Containers still run pre-reconciliation IMAGE code until step 2.1 rebuilds them.
- Research loop: 4 scheduled tasks, qwen3:8b think=false, baseline `factory_lm_loss
  5.61982`; ideation refills 00:00 nightly.
- Agent OS: J-Space state store (`skills/state_store.py`), Hermes/OpenClaw profiles,
  forge self-evolution loop all live-verified; scout has `reviewgraph`.

---

## 1 — Close the T9.3 gate (tonight, blocking everything downstream)

1.1 **Wait for `tool_final.pt`** (monitor fires; ETA ~8h from 15:20 start).
    - 1.1.a If the monitor reports crash/NaN instead: `docker logs dottie-factory-trainer-1`,
      diagnose, restart run — do NOT advance to 1.2 without a finished checkpoint.
1.2 **Run the eval gate against the checkpoint** (real harness, no shortcuts):
    - 1.2.a `cd apps/ava-factory && python eval_branch_harness.py --ckpt /ckpt/tool/tool_final.pt`
      (inside the GPU image: `docker compose exec trainer python eval_branch_harness.py ...`,
      or `server` service with `AVA_SKIP_ENGINE_BOOT=1` off-hours).
    - 1.2.b Compare tool-branch vs `base_final.pt` on: tool_selection routing accuracy
      (router argmax → planner on tool prompts), held-out LM loss on tool_use mix,
      frontier-rubric tool categories.
    - 1.2.c Record verdict in `apps/ava-factory/reports/REPORT_REAL.md` (committed) with
      the raw numbers. Acceptance: tool branch beats base on tool metrics WITHOUT
      >2% LM regression on the general mix.
1.3 **If gate passes → chat branch (T9.4)**: same overlay pattern,
    `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.tool-fork.yml run --rm trainer \
     python -m dottie.train --preset mini --branch chat --init /ckpt/base_final.pt --run /ckpt/chat`
    (50M tokens ≈ 90 min). Same gate discipline (1.2) for chat metrics.
1.4 **If gate fails**: file the failure mode in `TODOS.md` §8, adjust the branch spec
    (mix weights / router_bias in `configs/mini.yaml branches:`), rerun once. Two
    failures = stop and rethink the curriculum, not the knobs.

## 2 — Redeploy the fleet on reconciled code (after 1.1, before long collector runs)

2.1 **Rebuild + restart with the reconciled tree** (new datagen union + post-mini sources):
    - 2.1.a `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.tool-fork.yml build`
    - 2.1.b `docker compose ... up -d` **only when the trainer is between runs** — never
      yank a mid-run trainer.
    - 2.1.c Acceptance: 14/14 healthy 10 min later; `/pipeline/status` mode sane;
      collector logs show the NEW source keys (synpro, tool_use L2/L3, db/compress traces).
2.2 **Verify mixture flow end-to-end**: after 1h, `manifest` tokens_ready per phase
    rises; curator rejects stay <20%; no `unknown generator` errors anywhere.
2.3 **Retire the old checkouts** (they are now strictly historical):
    - 2.3.a `git -C C:\Users\jcdav\ava-agi status` → confirm nothing uncommitted worth saving.
    - 2.3.b Rename both dirs to `*-RETIRED-20260719` (do not delete yet); update
      `AVA_FACTORY_ROOT` in `research_env.local.ps1` to the MONOREPO factory path and
      re-register scheduler tasks; re-run `calibrate-baseline` if the packed corpus moves.
    - 2.3.c After 2 quiet weeks: delete.

## 3 — Promote mini to be Dottie's brain (the "assistant runs on OUR model" milestone)

3.1 **Serve the gated checkpoint**: point `server` service `AVA_CKPT` at the winning
    branch ckpt; `AVA_SKIP_ENGINE_BOOT=0` window (stop trainer first — 12 GB card).
3.2 **Wire dottie engine → local model**: `apps/dottie` policy currently defaults to
    Ollama; add a `DOTTIE_POLICY=factory` path that hits `:8000/generate` with the same
    honest-refusal semantics. Acceptance: `apps/dottie` test suite passes with the
    factory policy env set + one real conversation transcript saved to task_logs.
3.3 **A/B against qwen3:8b** on 20 fixed assistant prompts (tool selection, math,
    safety refusal); record per-prompt win/loss in `reports/` — promote only on ≥60% wins
    for tool tasks. Honest outcome if it loses: keep qwen3:8b, file gaps into §5.
3.4 **arxiviq assistant surface**: enable the server's CORS block for arxiviq.com
    (already reconciled in `server.py`), connect the site chat to `/generate`, stream
    tokens, log traces into `task_logs` (P5 anneal feedstock — closes the flywheel).

## 4 — Scale to base1b (only after 3.x proves mini is useful)

4.1 **Grow-init from the promoted mini** (machinery shipped in `89713ff`):
    - 4.1.a `python -m dottie.grow --src /ckpt/<winner>.pt --src-preset mini
      --dst-preset base1b --out /ckpt/base1b/grown_init.pt --validate`
    - 4.1.b Acceptance: `grown_loss` well below `fresh_dst_loss` in the validation
      block; manifest shows zero unexpected `dst_only` tensors.
4.2 **Memory feasibility on the 4080 — measure, don't argue**: `--max-steps 20` smoke
    with `optimizer.name: adamw8bit` (bitsandbytes is already wired in train.py),
    gradient_checkpointing on, micro-batch 1. Record torch peak alloc. If it spills
    >1 GB into sysmem → 4.4 (cloud) is the answer, full stop.
4.3 **Distillation pre-pass (optional, 2× sample efficiency)**: precompute top-8
    teacher logits (Qwen2.5-7B, Apache-2.0) over the M1 shard set (~32 GB disk);
    add a KL term gated by `training.distill:` config. Tokenizer decision first:
    adopting the teacher's tokenizer is the load-bearing choice — spec it before code.
4.4 **M1 milestone (2B tokens)**: local ≈ 2+ weeks 24/7 vs ~1-2 days on one rented
    A100-80GB. Gate at M1 per `configs/base1b.yaml milestones:` — "probes: arithmetic/
    logic clearly above mini" — before ANY further spend.

## 5 — Research loop: keep hill-climbing the architecture (∥ continuous)

5.1 **Tonight's cycle**: ideation refills at 00:00 with qwen3:8b; hourly ticks chew it.
    Morning check: `python -m dottie.research status` — expect ≥3 new experiments tried.
5.2 **Raise the conversion rate** (currently 0 of 7 candidates pass validation):
    - 5.2.a Add `--max-retries 5` for the implement worker on the scheduler (cheap now
      that transport bugs are gone — failures are content-level).
    - 5.2.b Nightly window: when the trainer is idle (post-tool_final, pre-next-run),
      let the scheduler use qwen3:14b (`DOTTIE_OLLAMA_MODEL_NIGHT` env in the wrapper,
      22:00–06:00) — 14b stalls only under GPU contention.
    - 5.2.c Feed `reviewgraph context` output into the correction prompt (the compact
      dependent-signature block) — the corrector currently sees only the traceback.
5.3 **Close the loop into the factory**: when an experiment reaches `sota`, generate a
    `deltanet_layers`-style patch PR against `model_1b.py` + a nano A/B run script;
    human-review gate before it touches mini/base1b presets.
5.4 **Report**: the arxiviq Research tab already renders `/research/status`; add the
    SOTA-vs-baseline sparkline once ≥2 sota points exist.

## 6 — Agent OS hardening (∥ with 1–5)

6.1 **Hermes auto-forge**: today `after_run` registers a routine sketch into
    skills_library; next: template that sketch into a real `forge new/edit` invocation
    behind `--refine` (human-confirmed), reusing the loop test's contract template.
6.2 **OpenClaw channels**: give `session_context` channels real meaning — `cli`,
    `arxiviq`, `research` — and make the dottie engine read/write the same store
    (`DOTTIE_STATE_DB` shared). Acceptance: a task started via scout is visible in the
    arxiviq assistant's context and vice versa.
6.3 **reviewgraph into the workflow**: pre-commit hook (or `scout system audit` step)
    that runs `reviewgraph blast --diff HEAD` and blocks on new high-fan-in touches
    without tests. Wire `context` into /code-review usage docs.
6.4 **Skill auto-docs**: `forge new` should scaffold SKILL.md (frontmatter:
    j_space_target, triggers) so `skill install` works without the manual step the
    loop test had to do.
6.5 **State-store telemetry cron**: hourly `export_telemetry` append into
    `reports/dottie_telemetry.jsonl` (gitignored) so agent activity reaches the
    Control Plane dashboards alongside factory telemetry.

## 7 — arxiviq.com platform polish

7.1 Control Plane fetches `dottie/main/apps/ava-factory/` — verify all dashboards
    render post-reconciliation (dashboard_html/ecosystem_html/evals_html were merged).
7.2 Assistant tab: 3.4's chat + a visible "which brain" indicator (factory ckpt vs
    Ollama fallback) — honesty in the UI too.
7.3 Research tab: 5.4. Factory tab: live tok/s + phase progress from `/pipeline/status`.
7.4 Uptime: the box sleeps → arxiviq shows stale. Either Task Scheduler wake or an
    honest "last seen" badge (prefer the badge; free-tier doctrine).

## 8 — Known issues backlog (honest ledger, none import-breaking)

- 6 × `test_audit_fixes` blueprint-judge failures (MetaMuseJudge.label, judge source
  literals) — the judge layer needs its own reconciliation pass vs workspace.
- 3 × `test_cpu_pilot_manifest` — environmental: expect `runs/cpu_pilot` artifacts;
  regenerate via `scripts/cpu_pilot_e2e.py` or mark skip-if-absent.
- 1 × `test_janitor` reclaim count (2 vs 1) — merged manifest lease/rescue additions
  changed delete accounting; decide intended semantics, fix code OR test.
- 1 × `test_server_endpoints` /report 404 fallback — merged server serves generated
  report_html; align test with intended behavior.
- 966 ruff findings in ported legacy code (CI excludes ava-factory; burn down
  opportunistically, never in bulk-reformat commits).
- 1 × `test_logic_prover` jsonl (ava-skills, pre-existing), 25 × scout-cli
  python3-stub subprocess tests (switch them to `sys.executable`).
- `test_flow` 3 disk-threshold failures — env-dependent thresholds; parametrize.

## 9 — Ops discipline (standing)

9.1 Monitors: keep the trainer monitor armed each run; add one for collector
    starvation (`tokens_ready` flat >6h → notify).
9.2 Weekly: `git gc` the monorepo, prune Docker images (`docker system df` first),
    check `ava_ckpt` volume growth vs janitor rotation.
9.3 Every session: `git pull` before committing (parallel Claude sessions are active);
    factory suite before any factory push; never leave conflict markers on disk in
    bind-mounted trees (the trainer restart-imports them).
9.4 Lane splits for parallel sessions: two agents racing on the same file
    (`adapters.py`/`sources.yaml`, observed 2026-07-19) resolved cleanly only by
    luck of additive edits — when spawning parallel work, assign disjoint file
    lanes explicitly (curriculum registry vs adapters vs tests), and the second
    lane pulls before touching anything shared.
