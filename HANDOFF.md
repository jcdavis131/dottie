# HANDOFF — pick up and execute this session's work

**For any assistant (or the operator) resuming Dottie work. Start here.**

The living source of truth is [`TODOS.md`](./TODOS.md) — read its **"YOUR DECISION QUEUE"**
section (search that header) and the **§5.3.R98–R100** entries at the top of the R-log. This
file is just the entry point; `TODOS.md` has the detail and stays current.

## Execute the queue TOP-DOWN — each item is a precondition for the ones below it

1. **Item 00 — reconcile git FIRST.** Local `main` is ahead of `origin/main` (unpushed
   session work) and behind by 2 (a parallel session's ruff reformat that **pruned `typing`
   imports this session's new code still uses**). A naive merge → `NameError: Dict is not
   defined` at import. **Verified procedure (§5.3.R99):**
   ```bash
   git merge origin/main            # resolve conflicts as "keep my logic, take their formatting"
   python -m ruff check --fix ; python -m ruff format   # normalises both sides; removes the NameError
   # then run the suites (see Environment) — a green suite proves the reconciliation held
   ```
2. **Item 0 / 5 — RE-SEED before restarting the daemon**, or the loop rejects every candidate
   against an unreachable baseline (the live baseline is a measured regression, §5.3.R93):
   ```bash
   python -m dottie.research calibrate-baseline --overwrite   # installs ≈5.737, ~6 min
   ```
3. **Item 0 — restart** (only after re-seed):
   ```powershell
   wsl --shutdown ; .\scripts\restart_research.ps1
   ```
4. **Items 1–8** unblock from there, in order. **Item 9 is WITHDRAWN** (was a false alarm —
   `apps/dottie` is green once `AVA_FACTORY_ROOT` is set).

## Environment

Tests **and** the trainer need:
```
AVA_FACTORY_ROOT=C:\Users\jcdav\workspace\ava-agi-factory-v6-4
```
The daemon sets it from the gitignored `apps/dottie/research_orchestration/research_env.local.ps1`.
Without it, `apps/dottie` reports ~36 failures that look like a broken repo and are not
(§5.3.R87). Run each suite from its own root; `apps/dottie` uses `apps/dottie/.venv`.

## Discipline (enforced conventions — TODOS ops §9.3–9.6)

- **`git fetch` before your FIRST commit** — parallel sessions push here (this is exactly how
  the divergence above happened).
- **`python scripts/check_todos_timestamps.py`** before committing any `TODOS.md` edit — it
  rejects fabricated clock times.
- **Read [`scripts/README.md`](./scripts/README.md)** before writing a new script — the
  operational tooling (restart/recovery, run-log reader, mutation audit, and the per-promotion
  `ab_nano.py` verifier) is indexed there.
- Never write a clock time that did not come from `date` or `git log` in the same tick.

## Status note

This file and `TODOS.md` are **local-only until item 00 is done** — `origin/main` does not yet
contain this session's work. After the git reconciliation pushes, this handoff becomes visible
to anyone with the repo. Until then, "pick up" means on this machine.
